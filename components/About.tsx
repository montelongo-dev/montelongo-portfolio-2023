            <h2 className="about_h2">
                In my current role as a Backend Web Developer, I have had the opportunity of
                gaining experience and working with a diverse range of programming languages
                and frameworks. This has allowed me to expand my skill set and tackle a wide
                variety of technical challenges. Currently, the majority of my project
                engagements revolve around Django and Wagtail CMS.

            <h2 className="about_h2">
                Before transitioning into web development, I spent a decade working as a Linux
                System Administrator, which equipped me with a strong foundation in DevOps
                practices. My extensive experience in server administration allowed me to
                seamlessly integrate DevOps principles into my workflow. From configuring
                development environments to deploying applications and quickly resolving
                server issues, my background in Linux administration has proven instrumental
                in effectively implementing DevOps methodologies.

            <h2 className="about_h2">
                During my spare time, I enjoy spending it with my family, expanding my
                knowledge of new technologies, playing and making guitars.
